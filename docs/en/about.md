# About

Open **Settings → About** to see the installed version, build information, project links, licenses, update status, and the optional feedback form.

## Updates

When automatic update checks are enabled, Agora checks for a newer release when the app starts, no more than once per day. The check only retrieves release metadata; installation remains an explicit user action and availability can differ between F-Droid, Google Play, and GitHub builds.

## Feedback

The rating form sends only the fields you deliberately submit—rating, name, email, and comment—to `https://newoether.com/api/rating`.

After an unexpected crash, Agora stores one pending report locally and, on the next launch, asks whether you want to send it. Nothing is uploaded without that explicit action. The report contains the stack trace, app/Android version, device manufacturer/model, timestamp, and bounded diagnostic event tags; it does not include conversation text, credentials, or device identifiers.

For data handling and network destinations, see [Privacy & Security](privacy.md).
